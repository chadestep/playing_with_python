# Scripts and Jupyter notebooks
This will eventually become various collections of scripts and notebooks that won't easily fall into newer repositories. For now, it'll just be where I store my python code.

(I'm in the slow process of updating this repository. An updated signal processing notebook is first on the docket)

# Electrophysiology analysis module
The 'ephys_analysis.py' module is slowly being built, so be patient. It's functional, but I'm already seeing ways of dramatically improving and cleaning the code in the short time I've been developing it. So, needless to say, please check back when I commit new changes.

Update 01/15/16
I've broken the single 'ephys_analysis.py' module into separate python files in an effort to work with another student on a proper analysis package. I've completely removed the plotting functions for now, but plan to package them with some new specialized plotting functions and add them back into to the analysis package as well. However, that will take some time to work out the bugs, so don't hold your breath.

# TODO:
* jupyter notebook describing module
* add exceptions to functions
* add signal processing and plotting functions
* clean and organize python repository
