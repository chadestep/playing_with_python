# Scripts and Jupyter notebooks
-
This will eventually become various collections of scripts and notebooks that won't easily fall into newer repositories. For now, it'll just be where I store my random python code and jupyter notebooks.

# Electrophysiology analysis module
Update (01/20/16): I'm moving all development of the ephys import and analysis package to [my lab's github repository](https://github.com/surmeierlab/analysis_code). Note, there's still a long way to go for us in terms of cleaning and organization, but it is coming along well and should be up and running in a few weeks at most.

~~I've broken the single 'ephys_analysis.py' module into separate python files in an effort to work with another student on a proper analysis package. I've completely removed the plotting functions for now, but plan to package them with some new specialized plotting functions and add them back into to the analysis package as well. However, that will take some time to work out the bugs, so don't hold your breath.~~
