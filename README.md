# Scripts and Jupyter notebooks
This will eventually become various collections of scripts and notebooks that won't easily fall into newer repositories. For now, it'll just be where I store my python code.

# Electrophysiology analysis module
I've broken the single 'ephys_analysis.py' module into separate python files in an effort to work with another student on a proper analysis package. I've completely removed the plotting functions for now, but plan to package them with some new specialized plotting functions and add them back into to the analysis package as well. However, that will take some time to work out the bugs, so don't hold your breath.

# TODO:
* jupyter notebook describing module
* add exceptions to functions
* add signal processing and plotting functions
* clean and organize python repository
