# Electrophysiology analysis module
Update (01/20/16): I'm moving all development of the ephys import and analysis package to [my lab's github repository](https://github.com/surmeierlab/neurphys). Note, there's still a long way to go for us in terms of cleaning and organization, but it is coming along well and should be up and running in a few weeks.
