# Scripts and Jupyter notebooks
This will eventually become various collections of scripts and notebooks that won't easily fall into newer repositories. For now, it'll just be where I store my python code.

(I'm in the slow process of updating this repository. An updated signal processing notebook is first on the docket)

# Electrophysiology analysis module
The 'ephys_analysis.py' module is slowly being built, so be patient. It's functional, but I'm already seeing ways of dramatically improving and cleaning the code in the short time I've been developing it. So, needless to say, please check back when I commit new changes.
